# Four-Legged Robot

**We built a four-legged robot from scratch!** 
It include designing, manufacturing, programming, electronics, and more. This repo contains the code of simulation and optimization algorithms.

# Motivation
This is based on the course project of Robotics Studio Spring 2020 at Columbia. We went an extra mile by adding more feature into the simulation.

# Features
random_search.py and hill_climbing.py execute a random search and a hill climbing algorithm respectively that search for parameters of sinusoidal function for each joint of the robot.

show_best.py use pybullet gui to show how the robot move in simulation

# Code Example

# Future Work
All gaits are executed open-looped, in other words, the robot moves without any feedback. Therefore, we intend to add some sensors in the simulation that make the robot move better and capable of more task.
